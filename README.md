# Papers Repository

This repository serves as a central archive for the computational work associated with my research papers. Its purpose is to provide a structured and version controlled space where each project can be tracked, updated, and reproduced over time.

## Overview

Every paper in my research workflow has its own directory within this repository. Each directory contains the scripts, notes, and supporting files that belong to that specific project. This layout keeps the work for each paper isolated and makes it easy to follow the development of different studies.

The role of this repository is to organize the computational side of the research process. It collects the code used to generate figures, run simulations, process data, or test ideas during the preparation of a manuscript. By keeping everything together, it becomes straightforward to revisit old projects or build new work on top of previous analyses.

## What to expect

Readers will find:

- A set of project folders, each corresponding to a separate paper.
- A consistent structure that makes it easy to navigate between projects.
- Individual README files inside each project directory that explain the purpose and content of that specific work.

This repository does not include large datasets or external resources. It focuses on the scripts and analysis steps that support the scientific results presented in the associated papers.

## Goal

The main goal of this repository is to improve clarity, reproducibility, and long term organization of my research code. It provides a single place where all computational work for each paper can be maintained and referenced as the research evolves.
